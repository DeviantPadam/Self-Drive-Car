# Self-Drive-Car
## 2-D Self driving car with Reinforcement learning 

### This project makes use of the following technologies:-

* Python 2.7.x
* Kivy
* PyTorch
* And a bunch of other python modules

### To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Install Anaconda(for beginners) or Python 2.7.x from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
1. Set up a virtual environment. Follow [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage) for more help
1. Next activate the virtual env by -
	* Linux/Mac - ``` source yourFolder/bin/activate ```
1. Install the required modules listed in __requirements.txt__

NOTE: The use of PyTorch over TensorFlow is because it computes dynamic graph calculations faster
